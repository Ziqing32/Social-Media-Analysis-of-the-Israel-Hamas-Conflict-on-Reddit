## Project Goals

### 1. Sentiment Dynamics Tracking 
- Analyze comment sentiment trends using `self_text` and `created_time`
- Use `score` and `controversiality` to gauge sentiment intensity and polarization


### 2. Topic Evolution Analysis
- Apply NLP (e.g. LDA topic modeling) to `self_text` and `created_time`
- Track how topics shift around key dates (e.g. 2023-10-07 Gaza attack)
